9/20/2022: Currently sick with COVID-19 and isolating off campus. I met with Jordan and was told to submit what I have for feedback. Will go back to make changes at a later date when I have recovered. Grading will be flexible given the circumstances. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
